## Assignment

<ol>
  <li>
    Calculate the resistivity of a Germanium semiconductor at room temperature using the four-probe method. Adjust the current source to <strong>30 mA</strong> in the simulator.
  </li>
  <li>
    Measure the change in resistivity of Germanium when the temperature is increased from <strong>30°C</strong> to <strong>50°C</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Measure the voltage developed across the inner probes of the four-probe when it is placed on a Silicon semiconductor by applying a current of <strong>100 mA</strong> at room temperature.
  </li>
  <li>
    Calculate the resistivity of Silicon at <strong>100°C</strong> by the four-probe method by applying <strong>20 mA</strong> current across the outer probes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Measure the voltage difference developed across the probes at <strong>80 mA</strong> for Germanium when the temperature is decreased from <strong>90°C</strong> to <strong>30°C</strong>.
  </li>
