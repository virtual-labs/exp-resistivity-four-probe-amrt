      "question": "Single-element semiconductors are characterized by atoms with how many valence electrons?",

        "a": "3",
        "b": "4",
        "c": "2",
        "d": "1"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – 3 valence electrons are typical for trivalent elements like boron.",
        "b": "Correct – elements like silicon and germanium have 4 valence electrons.",
        "c": "Incorrect – 2 valence electrons are not sufficient for forming the required bonds.",
        "d": "Incorrect – 1 valence electron is typical of alkali metals, not semiconductors."

      "answers": {
        "a": "holes",
        "b": "free electrons",
        "c": "holes and free electrons",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Partially correct – but electrons also contribute.",
        "b": "Partially correct – but holes also play a role.",
        "c": "Correct – both electrons and holes contribute to conduction.",
        "d": "Incorrect – conduction does occur via carriers."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – too high for germanium.",
        "b": "Incorrect – still high for intrinsic germanium.",
        "c": "Incorrect – very high compared to known intrinsic resistivity.",
        "d": "Correct – pure germanium has a low resistivity of around 6×10^-4 Ω·cm."
