      "question": "As temperature increases, the resistivity of a semiconductor",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Decreases",
        "b": "Increases",
        "c": "Remains constant",
        "d": "Decreases exponentially"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – it doesn't simply decrease linearly.",
        "b": "Incorrect – this is true for metals, not semiconductors.",
        "c": "Incorrect – resistivity is temperature dependent.",
        "d": "Correct – resistivity decreases exponentially with temperature increase due to more free charge carriers."
      },

      "question": "Doping of a semiconductor means",
      "answers": {
        "a": "adding impurities to increase the conductivity of material",
        "b": "adding impurities to decrease the conductivity of material",
        "c": "Removing of impurities from the material surface",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct – doping increases free charge carriers, improving conductivity.",
        "b": "Incorrect – doping enhances conductivity, not reduces it.",
        "c": "Incorrect – this describes cleaning, not doping.",
        "d": "Incorrect – option (a) is the accurate definition."
